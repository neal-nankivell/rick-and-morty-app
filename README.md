# Demo front end app using data from [rickandmortyapi](https://rickandmortyapi.com)

My goal with this app is to solidify knowledge around frameworks I'm already familiar with,<br>
As well as learn a few new libraries/frameworks I have no experience with.

## New things to learn

- [ ] [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [ ] [Emotion](emotion.sh)
- [ ] [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)

## Fimilar things to reinforce

- TypeScript
- Jest
- Enzyme
- Storybook
- React

I'm sure as I work through this there will be some change in direction and what things I would like to learn next.<br>
As this happens I will do my best to keep this up to date.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn storybook`

Start the storybook component explorer on port 9009, see [storybook.js.org](https://storybook.js.org/docs) for docs.

### `yarn build-storybook`

This will build the storybook configured in the Storybook directory into a static web app and place it inside the storybook-static directory. Now you can deploy the content in the storybook-static directory wherever you want.<br>
Docs for Exporting Storybook as a Static App can be found [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/exporting-storybook/#docs-content)
